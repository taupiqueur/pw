# pw

pw is a deterministic password generator that lets you
create passwords based on your master password with the following method.

```
base64(sha3_512("master_password,then,comma,separated,values"))
```

## Features

- Simple method.
- Avoids concepts and options when possible.
- Always provide `openssl` equivalent, so you donâ€™t depend on the tool itself.
- Copy passwords to the clipboard.
- Show typos in your master password.
